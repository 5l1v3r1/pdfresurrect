pdfresurrect
------------

PDFResurrect is a tool aimed at analyzing PDF documents.  The PDF format allows
for previous document changes to be retained in a more recent version of the
document, thereby creating a running history of changes for the document.  This
tool attempts to extract all previous versions while also producing a summary
of changes between versions.


Building
--------

From the top-level directory of pdfresurrect run:
    ./configure
    make

Debugging mode can be enabled when configuring by using the following option:
    ./configure --enable-debug

The resulting binary can be placed anywhere, as there is no "install" target in
the makefile.
