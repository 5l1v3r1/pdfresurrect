pdfresurrect
------------

PDFResurrect is a tool aimed at analyzing PDF documents.  The PDF format allows
for previous document changes to be retained in a more recent version of the
document, thereby creating a running history of changes for the document.  This
tool attempts to extract all previous versions while also producing a summary
of changes between versions.  This tool can also "scrub" or write data over the
original instances of PDF objects that have been modified or deleted, in an
effort to disguise information from previous versions that might not be
intended for anyone else to read.


Building
--------

From the top-level directory of pdfresurrect run:
    ./configure
    make

Debugging mode can be enabled when configuring by using the following option:
    ./configure --enable-debug

The resulting binary can be placed anywhere, as there is no "install" target in
the makefile.
